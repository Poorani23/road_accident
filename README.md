# Road Accident Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to understand the underlying patterns and factors influencing accidents. The analysis involves creating visualizations to explore different aspects of the data, such as the relationship between accidents and factors like day of the week, severity, road surface conditions, speed limits, location (urban or rural), junction types, light conditions, and temporal trends.

## Key Objectives

1. **Day of the Week Analysis**: Investigate how the number of accidents varies across different days of the week using appropriate visualizations.

2. **Accident Severity Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of accident severity levels to understand the frequency and impact of different severity types.

3. **Road Surface and Weather Conditions**: Explore the most common types of road surfaces under different weather conditions to identify potential risk factors.

4. **Speed Limit and Accident Severity**: Examine the relationship between speed limits and the severity of accidents to understand the impact of speed on accident outcomes.

5. **Urban vs. Rural Accidents**: Determine whether accidents are more frequent in urban or rural areas, which could inform targeted safety measures.

6. **Junction Types**: Identify the most common types of junctions where accidents occur, potentially highlighting areas for infrastructure improvements.

7. **Light Conditions and Casualties**: Investigate how light conditions (e.g., daylight, darkness) influence the number of casualties in accidents.

8. **Temporal Trends**: Analyze the trend of accidents over time to identify patterns or changes that may inform future preventive measures.

Through these analyses, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to road accidents, which can help inform safety initiatives, infrastructure improvements, and policy decisions to reduce the occurrence and severity of accidents.
